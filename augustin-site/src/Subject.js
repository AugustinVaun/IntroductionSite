            <h1 className='title'>About Me</h1>
            Aerospace engineer by trade, Software engineer through hobbies. I am more inclined towards Frontend, but I find the intricacies of Backend to be fascinating, and Fullstack to be thrilling on its own.

            In a previous life, my role as a Navy Junior Officer allowed me to understand what it means to lead and to endorse responsibilities, all the while rising to my superiorsâ€™ expectations.

            Living abroad (meaning for the average Frenchman, outside of France) for a great part of my life has taught me valuable communication skills and openness of mind as well as a mastery of both German and English.
